Challenge 2 for Stock Analysis - VBA
# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor a solution code to make it morre efficient and potientally run faster.  I am looking to refactor this code so it can be used on larger data sets.  The first attempt at the code was to gather information on stocks from specific data sheets.  The data sheeets containeed information on twelve different stocks.  From the data, I pulled information on the stock volume and return, depending on what year the user would input.  In this code, I used a nested for loop, which looped through each row of data for each of the twelve stocks.  The times it took for execute the code for data sheets 2017 and 2018 are below: <br />
